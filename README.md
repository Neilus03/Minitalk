# Minitalk

Welcome to my "Minitalk" project from 42! ðŸš€

This repository contains my implementation of the "Minitalk" project, a networked application that allows communication between a client and a server using signals. The project focuses on signal handling, interprocess communication, and synchronization.

## Introduction

The **Minitalk** project aims to create a simple networked application using signals for interprocess communication. The client sends a string message to the server, and the server displays the received message. Signal handling and synchronization are crucial aspects of this project.

## Compile and Run

To compile the **Minitalk** project, you can use the provided Makefile. The project requires the "libft" and "ft_printf" libraries, which are also compiled using their respective Makefiles.

To compile both the client and the server, run the following command:
